# Demo: Folder

## Setup

- No dependency on package in `package.json`
- Direct import from relative folder `../../package` in function

## Commands
```
npm run build-node-esbuild
npm run build-cloudflare
npm run build-node-webpack
npm run build-worker-webpack
npm run build-node-rollup
npm run build-worker-rollup
```

## Result

- Build succeeds, but includes content of `main.js` ðŸ”´ in bundle for `*-worker-*` and `*-cloudflare` builds
- Build succeeds, but includes content of `main.js` âœ… in bundle for `*-node-*` builds

(Without `main` entry in `package.json` it would fail and not find the package)
